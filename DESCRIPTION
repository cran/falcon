Title: Finding Allele-Specific Copy Number in Next-Generation
        Sequencing Data

Depends: R (>= 3.0.1)
Description: This is a method for Allele-specific DNA Copy Number Profiling using Next-Generation Sequencing.  Given the allele-specific coverage at the variant loci, this program segments the genome into regions of homogeneous allele-specific copy number.  It requires, as input, the read counts for each variant allele in a pair of case and control samples. For detection of somatic mutations, the case and control samples can be the tumor and normal sample from the same individual.
